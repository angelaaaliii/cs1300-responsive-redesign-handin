      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        In this project, I took a business's website and
        indentified its key accessibility & efficiency, learnability, 
        and memorability issues. Then, working to fix these problems, 
        I redesigned the website to address these points. 
        The end goal of the business's website focuses 
        on its desired metric: sales and customers.
